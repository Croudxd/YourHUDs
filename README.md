<h2>YourHUDs</h2>
A small application to allow user's to automatically install custom TF2 HUD's into their TF2 Path. Using C++, Qt and python.

This application is built for windows, and currently remains untested on Linux and Unix devices.

It's as a simple as a user clicking on a HUD they wish to install. Clicking the installation button. Which will download a ZIP file from GitHub of one of the many HUDs customized by other user's and directly install and unzip into a directory of your choosing.

**Requirements:**
 - Windows
 - Latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) with it in your PATH variables.

For anyone wanting to customize the source code and add own HUD's/buttons. Its as simple as creating a button, and using the setHud() function to assign all the required data for the hud class. Once done you should be able to automatically install the new HUD.

**Upcoming features:**
 - Allow user's to add custom HUDs within the GUI, no need to edit the source code.
 - Store the user's install path so user's do not need to re-enter it when trying to install (Not for the first time).
 - General over-all bug fixes.
 - Add a progress bar for installation.
 - Adding more HUDs.

**How to install:**
- Go to releases, install latest release.
- Once installed unzip into any directory.
- Open the exe, but make sure not to move the exe out of the zip file, this will mess up the program.
- Click a HUD to install, you can use the left and right buttons to see the different pictures.
- Click install and Enter your TF2 custom path such as  `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom` for most users.
- Give 10-15 seconds and it will be installed.

### This project has been archieved and is no longer updated.
This was a fun project which helped teach me QT in c++, it was also a good starter with getting me programming with files. And also gave me a good idea of a more dynamic code base and how to use that in the frontend which has definetly trasnfered to some of my other projects over the years.
